# 🧠 YouTube Video QA Chatbot using RAG + LLM

This project is an intelligent chatbot that allows users to ask questions about the content of any YouTube video. It uses **transcript-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** along with a **locally running LLM** for fast, accurate answers.

---

## 📌 Features

* 🔗 **YouTube Transcript Extraction**: Automatically extracts captions using `YouTubeTranscriptAPI`
* 🧩 **Text Chunking**: Uses `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` for manageable chunks with context overlap
* 🧠 **Embeddings + FAISS**: Embeds chunks using `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` and indexes them with FAISS for fast similarity search
* 🤖 **LLM Inference**: Loads a 4-bit quantized **Phi-3.5-mini-instruct** model via `Unsloth` for lightweight, fast inference
* 💬 **LangChain Integration**: Uses `RunnableLambda`, prompt templates, and chat message formats (Human + AI) for clean RAG workflows
* ✅ **Context-Aware Answers**: The bot only responds using information from the transcript; if the context is insufficient, it says so

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User inputs a YouTube URL**
2. Transcript is downloaded and split into overlapping text chunks
3. Chunks are embedded and stored in a FAISS vector database
4. When a user asks a question:

   * Relevant chunks are retrieved
   * A prompt is formed with context + question
   * Passed to a local 4-bit LLM using Unsloth
5. The model generates a response based only on the retrieved context
